# LangProfiler

## Introduction

Modern AI systems often rely on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), each with distinct capabilities and behaviors. Some excel at creative generation, others at factual correctness, and still others at specialized domains such as finance or medicine. To make informed decisions about which model (or agent) to use for a given task, developers need clear insights into each model’s strengths and weaknesses. 

**LangProfiler** is a **standalone profiling tool** that addresses this need. By collecting and analyzing performance data from various LLMs or LLM “agents” (where each agent could have its own specialized instructions and configurations), LangProfiler outputs easy-to-use profiles. These profiles capture essential metrics—like accuracy, cost efficiency, domain coverage, and more—and turn them into a standardized representation.

With LangProfiler, developers can:

1. **Identify the best LLM or agent** for a given use case.  
2. **Track improvements or regressions** in LLM performance over time.  
3. **Quickly integrate with other modules** (e.g., multi-agent frameworks, memory solutions, and workflow orchestrators) to build robust, intelligent systems.

LangProfiler is designed to fit seamlessly into the broader ecosystem that includes:
- **LangSwarm** – multi-agent solution for consensus, aggregation, voting, etc.  
- **MemSwarm** – centralized and cross-agent memory solution.  
- **LangRL** – a reinforcement learning orchestration layer for workflows and agent selection.  

In short, LangProfiler is the “eyes and ears” for your AI architecture: it quantifies the performance of each agent and shares that knowledge so other modules can make better decisions.

## Detailed Description

### 1. Core Concept

LangProfiler manages and maintains **profiling data** for each LLM or agent. An “agent” could be:

- **A distinct LLM** (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama 2).  
- **A specialized persona or instruction set** within the same LLM (e.g., “Medical Agent,” “Creative Agent,” “Financial Agent”).

Each agent’s **profile** is stored as a **fixed-size vector** (or embedding) plus supplemental metadata. This vector encodes various attributes such as:

- **Cost**: estimated or actual cost per token or per request.  
- **Latency**: average response time.  
- **Domain Expertise**: medical, legal, creative writing, coding, etc. (often captured via multi-hot or numeric fields).  
- **Empirical Performance Metrics**: accuracy on test sets, user satisfaction ratings, or specialized scores (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.).  
- **Other Attributes**: training data cutoff, maximum context window, versions, etc.

### 2. Data Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: As agents handle tasks, you log relevant details (domain, user feedback, performance outcomes).  
2. **Aggregator/Encoder**: LangProfiler uses a small neural network (or other aggregator) to translate these raw inputs into a consistent, fixed-size embedding.  
3. **Storage & Versioning**: Profiles are updated incrementally whenever new performance data is available. Older versions are retained or aggregated for historical analysis.  
4. **Querying**: External modules (e.g., LangSwarm, LangRL) can query LangProfiler to get the **most recent** or **historically best** profile of an agent.

### 3. Integration with the Ecosystem

- **LangSwarm**: When multiple agents propose different solutions, LangSwarm can reference LangProfiler’s data to weigh each agent’s trustworthiness or domain expertise during voting or consensus processes.  
- **MemSwarm**: The memory system can store and retrieve references to agent profiles, ensuring consistent knowledge sharing across the entire multi-agent setup.  
- **LangRL**: During workflow orchestration or agent selection, LangRL uses LangProfiler’s embeddings to pick the most suitable agent(s). This might include balancing **accuracy vs. cost**, or selecting agents that excel in the relevant domain.

## How to Use LangProfiler

Below is a **step-by-step** guide for developers who want to incorporate LangProfiler into their workflows.

### Step 1. **Install & Configure LangProfiler**
1. **Obtain the LangProfiler Package**: Install it in your environment (e.g., via pip or a local library).  
2. **Set Up a Database or Storage Layer**: LangProfiler needs somewhere to record profile data (SQL database, NoSQL, or an in-memory store).  
3. **Initialize the Profiler**: Provide initial configuration (feature definitions, aggregator/encoder model settings, default domain categories, etc.).

### Step 2. **Register Agents**
1. **Create Agent Entries**: For each LLM or agent persona, register it with LangProfiler.  
2. **Assign Basic Features**: Cost, domain flags, token limits, etc. This forms your **manual baseline** before you gather empirical data.  
3. **Get Agent IDs**: LangProfiler will generate unique identifiers for each agent, enabling consistent tracking.

### Step 3. **Log Interactions & Performance Data**
1. **Integration Hooks**: Add code hooks in your application so that **each request** and **its outcome** are logged back to LangProfiler.  
2. **Metrics & Feedback**: Supply numeric scores (accuracy on a known test set) or user feedback (ratings, thumbs-up/down) to help refine agent profiles.  
3. **Automatic Encoding**: LangProfiler’s aggregator updates each agent’s embedded profile vector in response to new data.

### Step 4. **Query & Retrieve Profiles**
1. **Direct API Calls**: Modules like LangRL or LangSwarm can request the current profile for “Agent X.”  
2. **Similarity Search**: If you have a specific “query embedding” or a set of required attributes, you can let LangProfiler **rank** which agent(s) best match your need.  
3. **Version Control**: Retrieve historical profiles if you need to audit or analyze performance over time.

### Step 5. **Refine & Iterate**
1. **Add More Features**: Over time, you may decide to track additional metrics. Update your aggregator network and re-run profiling.  
2. **Continuous Improvement**: As new data streams in, the aggregator can become more accurate at representing agent capabilities.  
3. **Collaborate & Share**: If multiple teams use LangProfiler, consider sharing profile data and best practices for aggregator tuning.

## Example Use Case

1. A developer wants to build a **medical Q&A system**.  
2. They create two specialized “Doctor Agents” (both powered by GPT-4) but with different instruction prompts and knowledge resources.  
3. They **register** each agent in LangProfiler, providing initial tags like `["medical"]` and cost info.  
4. They run test queries from a medical QA dataset, logging success/failure rates.  
5. LangProfiler **updates** each agent’s embedded profile to reflect how they performed.  
6. When a user asks a new medical question, the **LangRL** system retrieves profile embeddings, compares them to the user’s query requirements, and selects the best “Doctor Agent.”
